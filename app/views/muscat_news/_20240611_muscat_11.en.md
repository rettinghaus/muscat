## Welcome to Muscat 11!
This major update brings many enhancements for Muscat catalogers.

* In fields with autocomplete, a number appears next to the term that shows how often the term is used in Muscat.
  * The terms are ordered by frequency to identify the most common terms faster.
* Printed editions with links to digitized versions are easier to identify.
* As you page forwards or backwards through records, a counter will tell you where you are in your list of results.
* Multiple browser tabs in Muscat:
  * It is now possible to have different searches in different open tabs.
  * Searches do not interfere with each other.
* Muscat will warn you if you try to log out when multiple tabs are open. 
* Export of folders in MARCXML has been improved.
* In full record views, place names are displayed next to institutions (such as **Universität, Innsbruck** rather than just **Universität**).
* Field names were updated, clarified, and unified across Muscat areas.
* New languages and countries in the drop-down menus: Turkish, Benin, Bolivia, Ghana, Liechtenstein, Peru, Suriname, Uganda.
* A new search box is available for the record owners: just start typing and the options appear.
* For citing identifiers from the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the ARK resolver format has been standardized.
* The occasional error "Error in validation process" has been fixed.
* Improvements to the authority file for Works: validations, attribution qualifiers, functions, relationships, language codes, work catalog notes.
* The unused field 100$w (Status) in Personal names was removed.
* Special thanks once again to Ferran Jorba and his team (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona) for their contributions to Muscat!
