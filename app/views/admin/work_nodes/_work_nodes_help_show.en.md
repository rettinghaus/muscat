The **Work nodes** items act as labelled links between sources in Muscat and external work authorities (e.g., GND works) and regroup sources sharing the same reference. They serve as authority data proxy stored in Muscat for facilitating the handling of the links with the external authority dataset.

Work nodes are themselves not exported as authority date, and work nodes IDs are not exposed externally. However, work nodes are listed in the source records pointing to them through a custom Marc field 930, together with work ID of the external work authority dataset (e.g., the GND ID).
