The **Work nodes** serve as a link between sources in Muscat and external work authorities. Within Muscat, they group sources sharing the same external work authority ID number. A link to an existing, external work authority, preferably to the GND from the German National Library (DNB), is required to create a work node.

Work nodes are not exported as authority data, and work nodes do not have external ID numbers. They are linked in the source records through the field **External work reference** (930), and link to the external authority through that authority's work ID number.
